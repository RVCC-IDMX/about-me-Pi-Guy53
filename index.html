                <h2> Bio:</h2>

                    <p>
                        Vearin Terril grew up under the name of Kyriakos Mareth, in a city which was once called New York. When he was young he would code robotics, and was liked to tinker with AI coding. This changed however when he was 13, and a rival nation attacked the City. During this attack, most of his family was killed by Tenebrous City's own AI defense network. Since then Vearin has had a vindeta against AI's.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        During the rebuilding of New York (renamed Tenebrous City due to the twisted nature of most of its buildings), it became apperent that the government only cared for using the attack as propeganda to build fortifications, and expand the military. The people of the city were left to fend for themselves, and Vearin started plotting to takeover Tenebrous City, to try and improve living conditions for the masses.
                        Years later he joined the AMSR (Advanced Military Space Reserves) for training, and access to their advanced technologie in preperation for this takeover.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Leaving the AMSR on good terms, he iniciated the takeover.
                        The attack was successful, and with relativly little bloodshed. Too successful in fact.
                        The government agreed to his terms, but he was branded a Terrorist, and was forced to leave Earth and flee to JSC space. Once on one of the moons of Jupiter he changed his name to Vearin Terril, and used the skills he learned with the AMSR to start a Defense Contracting Business.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His DCB has become very successful, expanding to the point of being able to rival small governments. What started out as a small business of one, has become large enough that even high profile corporations such as GIC, and IIC, contract out to him. The UNE still occasionally sends bounty hunters after Vearin, but these have slowed down once the Hunters realized just how dangerous he was. It became a point where the Bounty Hunters guild has put a minimum Bounty out for Vearin because he is so dangerous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A point to be noted is that, he is so well liked by those he employs that they gladly intercept, and eliminate the bounty hunters before they reach him. Vearin for his part was extremly annoyed when he found out they did this. He does not want them to risk themselves for 'his' battles.

                            Embedding a Google Map or Route into a webpage is very similar to embedding a normal iFrame. You just need the source, and optional CSS styling. There is a Google Maps API you can use, but you do not have to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To obtain a Google Map iFrame you can, go to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">maps.google.com</a> and search for a place or business. Once you have your desired location you will need to get the iFrame code. To do so, look on the left side of the screen, where you typed your search query, is the directions/navigation panel, on the right side of this panel is a "share" button, click that and select the "Embed a Map" tab. Readjust your map view as desired, and then copy the code it generated. Past this iFrame code into your webpage HTML, and you are done. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            This is just the basic iFrame, you can now style it to fit into the rest of page. To do so you can wrap the iFrame in a div or section that has an ID, or Class, and use these to modify the iFrame's size, and minor style adjustments. The Google GUI itself however cannot be modified.

                <h2>
                    From: Dracula
                </h2>

                <div>
                    <p>I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door. "My God!" he said; "this is dreadful. There is no time to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is it you or me?"</p>

                    <p>I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me."</p>

                    <p>Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared."</p>

                    <p>I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper:--</p>

                    <p>Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming." When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand:--</p>

                    <p>Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that." For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. "You are to help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your best help."</p>

                    <p>What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me, and I shall do it. My life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her." The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--</p>

                    <p>My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!"</p>

                    <p>What shall I do?" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. "Come!" he said. "You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than me, better than my friend John." Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--</p>

                    <p>Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is the more young and strong than me"--here Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence--"but, now you are here, you are more good than us, old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!" Arthur turned to him and said:--</p>
