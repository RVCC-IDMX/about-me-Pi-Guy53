The HTML project for a web site that is 'About Me' or rather about a certain Mr. Vearin Terril

This project was to learn about HTML and CSS coding, as well as to poke a little into JS. I learned how to create headers, tables, use grid and flex layouts, as well as how to target specific elements for styling (such as drop caps for letters)

<span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>.
