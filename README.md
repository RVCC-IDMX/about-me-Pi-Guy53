The HTML project for a web site that is 'About Me' or rather about a certain Mr. Vearin Terril

This project was to learn about HTML and CSS coding, as well as to poke a little into JS. I learned how to create headers, tables, use grid and flex layouts, as well as how to target specific elements for styling (such as drop caps for letters) 
I also researched how to embed a google map into an HTML page using iFrames, and discovered that check box input fields can be used in unforseen ways. In this case I was able to learn how to use input checkboxes to store state and to be able to show/hide a menu bar.

In addition to this, About Me was to showcase a little about myself, and to put that into a format that others could read, and appreciate. In my case however, I did not want information about me online, and so chose to use the Character persona of Vearin Terril. I took this an an oppertunity to showcase him, and a little about the world he lives in.
